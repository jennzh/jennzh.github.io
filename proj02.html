							<!-- Overview -->
							 <section>
								<h2>01. Overview</h2>
								<p> ask chat: Take this example and formulate it for a local small business named VOJO Silk. VOJO Silk focused on making silk products-specifically silk scrunchies-aimed towards maintaining healthy hair while staying stylish. I was taaked with designing a homepage, gallery page, product page, and checkout experience. "The Nail Hub, a leading gel nail polish brand for both DIY and professional salon shoppers, approached Adspace Agency to optimize their online shopping experience through a comprehensive CRO website redesign. I was tasked with tackling the homepage, collection page, product page, and checkout experience, implementing user-friendly navigation and intuitive product segmentation/filtering to guide shoppers to their desired products with ease. By tailoring the shopping journey to the needs of each type of customer, we were able to increase conversion rate and provide a seamless shopping experience for all." </p>

							 <section>
								<h2> 02. Problem</h2>
								<p>ask chat: Take this example and formulate it for VOJO Silk. The business-VOJO Silk- has just launched and the owner's concern was how the website template designs do not match the auesthetic of the products and company image. In addition, it was also difficuly to navigate and locate the products due to inconsistent organization of each product listed on the website. keep the part that mentiones high bounce rates and low conversation rates as well as the product filtering issue. use this template "Before the redesign, The Nail Hub's website had a major problem with user journey and experience, as their customers - both DIY and professional salon shoppers - found it difficult to navigate and locate the products they needed. For example, DIY shoppers were being led to products suited for salon owners, leading to high bounce rates and low conversion rates. Additionally, the website's navigation and product filtering was cluttered, making it hard for users to navigate through the site and find what they were looking for."</p>
